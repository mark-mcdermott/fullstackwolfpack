## Big O

"Big O" notation is a measurement of how complex an algorithm is. The more times a loop executes in code, the higher the big O will be. Big O notation is written in terms of n.  N here represents the number of times a section of code will execute. Big O is way to speak about how fast an algorithm will run relative to another.

### Subtitle Here

A simple loop in big O notation is just n, which is considered linear.  If the loop is run more times, the code is run only that number of times. This code is O(n) or "O of n".  Here we say "O" as in the letter O, pronounced like "oh".

A nested loop in big O notation is considered O(n<sup>2</sup>). If the loop is run more times, the entire inner loop is executed for each increase of 1 in the outer loop.

Some commonly seen big O notation figures are (from slowest to fastest):

<table>
<tr><td>O(1)</td><td>bounded time</td></tr>
<tr><td>O(log n)</td><td>logarithmic time</td></tr>
<tr><td>O(n)</td><td>linear time</td></tr>
<tr><td>O(n log n)</td><td>n log n time</td></tr>
<tr><td>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</td><td>quadratic time</td></tr>
<tr><td>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</td><td>cubic time</td></tr>
<tr><td>O(2<sup>n</sup>)</td><td>exponential time</td></tr>
</table>
