Data structures are how programming languages store and operate on data. Data structures can be simple like arrays or more complicated like binary trees. Data structures have storage and operations. The formal definition of a data structure is, "a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. [1]"
