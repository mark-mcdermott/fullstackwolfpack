Flashcard review is a great way to memorize computer science knowledge and a great way to keep from forgetting it as time goes on.  Here I've prepared flashcard sets in a variety of computer science areas, both academic and applied. Over time I plan to expand the topics covered.

I also plan on continuing to develop this flashcard software. I plan on bringing it to desktop, mobile and to personal assistants like Google Home and Alexa for studying on the go. I'll also build out a section where you can log in and it will track your progress and suggest what areas to brush up on.
