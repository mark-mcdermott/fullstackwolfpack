Here I have online lessons in computer science skills. I cover both academic and applied topics. Of course, there are many other resources out there to learn these topics. I hope to eventually have enough comprehensively covered topics to be of value to folks. I aim to eventually have close to the same amount and depth of material covered in an undergraduate computer science course. I hope to compliment those academic topics with current real world topics.

Material here is free to use in any way you like.  School is so expensive and time consuming, I see no reason in 2019 that we don't have many free, in-depth resources that cover the whole computer science discipline to the same depth that a degree program would.
